# General questions

* The second examiner box on front page of exam scripts is not used?
  Are these scripts moderated/second marked (cf MOD002641 and
  MOD006561)?


# MOD002641 - Data Structures and Algorithms

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 

## Main exam script (element 010):
ok but how are these scripts second marked (see question above)?

## Coursework (element 011):
ok.

# MOD002726 - Postgraduate Major Project

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 

## Trimester 1

how does the internal moderation process work? I am surprised all 3
marks are the same for each student in the module report (this doesn't
seem to match marks from 1st/2nd marker in the feedback, nor the
report for Trimester 2). Is there an additional moderation step?
  
## Trimester 2
ok.


# MOD003264 - Digital Security

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 


Three locations: CAM – HCT – CWK. Very small numbers outside of CAM
(180 vs 5) so hard to compare.

# MOD004364 - Advanced Web Solutions

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 


# MOD005618 - Object Orientated Modelling and Data Design

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 


# MOD005622 - Object Orientated Software Development

The work has been marked fairly and consistently. 


# MOD006561 - Artificial Neural Networks

* Was low attendance also a problem in other modules for this cohort?

* Coursework: ok

* Exam: ok but how are these scripts second marked (see question above)?


# MOD007357 - Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures



# Global comments:

- second marking could be more clearly shown

- add distribution on moderation reports

- quite high number of non-submissions

- it would be good to present MAP boxes accross modules and
  locations. For instance moderation samples for MOD003264 are given
  in three quite different styles for each location. All locations
  should follow the Cambridge style, ideally. Links to samples (incl
  feedback) from moderation form is most convenient.
