# MOD002641	Data Structures and Algorithms
The assignment is well designed and appropriate for the level.

Both exam papers are well designed and appropriate for the level. I do
wonder why the main and resit exams are so different (in style and
structure). It this common practice in the department?

Minor comments for the main exam:

Q2: space missing in "index, i,using "

Q7: Writing something like the model answer would be rather time
consumming / error prone. It would be good to help studenst with
this. A smaller array possibly? (I don't have a better suggestion for
now)




# MOD002701	Developing Web Applications
The assignment is well designed and appropriate for the level.

# MOD002726	Postgraduate Major Project
All assignment briefs are well designed and appropriate for the level.

Minor comment: the sample project timescale includes a 'binding'
activity. Are the dissertations submitted physically?

# MOD003264	Digital Security

The assignment is well designed and appropriate for the level.

In both class tests, the vast majority of the multiple choice
questions appear to only test terminology knowledge (pure
'recall'). It would be good to include a couple of questions that
require students to show a contextualised understanding of the
concepts covered in the courses, ideally by making them draw links
between several covered topics.

* Main class test
Why isn't there a crypto question in the main class test?
Q57: no capital to Protocols.

* Resit class test
Q6: Asks -> ask (no 's', no capital)
Q32: 'fi le' -> file

MOD005618 - Object Orientated Modelling and Data Design
ELEMENT 010: The assignement is well designed and appropriate for the level.
ELEMENT 011: The assignement is well designed and appropriate for the level.

NB: Both assignments are accompanied with a very nice representation
of the marking scheme, but I wonder if the descriptions in the column
"Sufficient" (D+ to D-) can be improved so that each description
include some “minimal qualities” instead a list shortcomings/errors
(beyond 'some efforts'). I appreciate that it might not always be easy
to do.
