*MOD002643 (Image Processing) - Assignment 1500 words*

Nice project. Tasks increase in difficulty nicely. Thorough coding
guidelines, althought it is not entirely clear how they are enforced
in the marking scheme.

Typos in canvas description: Question 1..6 and 8 are *worsth* 10%
(...) *worst*




*MOD002726 (Postgraduate Major Project) - 2 components - 15000 words equivalent*

--> this link points to MOD007891.


*MOD003263 (Software Engineering) - Multiphase group-based
 assessment. Equivalent of 6000 words per group member*

NB: I got "File Not Found" when access the file linked from "Case
Study for the assignment can be found <here>".

Objectives and marking schemes appear reasonable to me.



*MOD004553 (Artificial Intelligence) - Software development (3000
 words equivalent)*

Nice game-oriented project. Clear marking scheme.



*MOD004881 (Object Oriented Programming) - Coding task (equivalent to
 2500 words)*

Nice, realistic project. Clear marking scheme.  Is there a possibility
for student's project to be commercialised? What happens wrt
intellectual property here?


*MOD004881 (Object Oriented Programming) - Report (1500 words)*

Ok.




*MOD007891 (Programming with Python) - ASSIGNMENT (REPORT/PROJECT) -
 2,500 WORDS*
 

Good set of exercises, from guided ones to more open harder questions,
all with real-world problems/data.

What is the rationale for the bonus question appearing before the last
10% question?
